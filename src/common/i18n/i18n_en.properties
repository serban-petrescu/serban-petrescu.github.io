#about
aboutText=Hi! I'm Serban, an IT enthusiast which graduated Computer Science at TU-CN and works full time at msg-systems Romania.\n\n\
I have always been interested in computers and, since high school, programming has been my main passion. During the recent years, \
I've worked with many programming languages and many technologies. I believe that a programmer must be versatile and using all sorts \
of languages, ranging from 1st generation machine language to 4th generation languages like ABAP or PHP, strengthens one's versatility. \n\n\
This very website was built by me from scratch in an attempt to share (and show off) my work and knowledge.

prjWorkGsa=Guided Selling Advisor
prjWorkGsaDesc=Architect and lead developer for building a suite of reusable microservices supporting \
business applications for a market-leading manufacturing company. The microservices were developed using Spring \
Boot and deployed on the SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry. This project served as a blueprint for the customer \
for all further cloud-based projects. During the course of the project, I've had a major role in guiding the \
customer through the various architectural decisions, whilst also implementing the most technically \
challanging components.

prjWorkMsgCM=msg.CandidateManagement
prjWorkMsgCMDesc=An internal project for managing our job candidates (especially the students). The project is being built \
using Spring Boot and a MySQL database, with React and Redux on the front-end. My role is that of a coordinator and middle-man \
between the development team and the stakeholders.

prjWebPaint=Web-based Paint
prjWebPaintDescr=It started as a simple Java Application for college. Then I decided to try to move the functionality to a HTML 5 app. \
It allows the user to draw by drag-and-dropping simple shapes (rectangle, circle, line, etc.), more complex shapes (stars, stickmen, etc.) and even to \
import external pictures. The user can also resize, move and change the colors of the shapes, use undo-redo functionality, save or load \
drawing files (.json format) and also to export to PNG.
prjWebPaintS1=The main drawing area of the application, with the shape palette on the top and the objects' properties on the left.

prjGDE=Graphical Development Environment
prjGDEDescr=An application which can be used to write imperative Java code by dragging and dropping functional blocks. \
The generated code can also be displayed inside the application, compiled and run. The front-end is done in HTML5 and the \
back-end is built in Java (it consists of an embedded HTTP server).
prjGDES1=The drag-and-drop area of the application. The functional blocks can be dragged from the menu strip on the right \
and properties of each block can be set using the Properties toolbox. Blocks can be moved and their contents explored.
prjGDES2=The generated code area (corresponding to the previous schematic).
prjGDES3=The console area after compiling and running the Java schematic (can be done using either buttons or console commands).

prjEvid=Job Registry
prjEvidDescr=This project was built in my spare time for a relative of mine which is a land surveyor. Using it, one can keep \
track of all jobs and court terms for judicial expertise jobs. It offers a calendar for seeing court dates and automatically reads \
data from the Ministry of Justice Web API and the National Agency for Cadaster and Land Registration website to update \
the data accordingly.
prjEvidS1=The job registry. Each line represents a job. The user can search through the jobs, add a new one, sort them, \
edit, delete or expand a job to see further attributes.
prjEvidS2=An expanded job, showing the data retrieved from the Agency's website (the last row).
prjEvidS3=A fast entry screen, which can be used to enter the inquiry number for a job (after it was given to the Agency).
prjEvidS4=A fast entry screen, which can be used to change the status of a job.
prjEvidS5=The court terms calendar.

prjFact=Invoice Generator
prjFactDescr=This is an application built on top of OpenOffice which can be used to manage invoices for \
a small company. It allows the user to define multiple profiles, it keeps track of customer data (for recurring customers) \
and generates OpenOffice files with the invoices (using a user-defined template).
prjFactS1=The profile creation / modification screen.
prjFactS2=The main screen. Allows the user to enter various data related to the invoice, to save, restore, print or even \
create a receipt for the invoice (opens a separate application). A summary of all invoices can also be generated.
prjFactS3=A demo invoice generated by the program.
prjFactS4=A demo invoice summary also generated by the program.

prjChit=Receipt Generator
prjChitDescr=A sister-application (for generating receipts) of the invoice generation. Either standalone receipts \
or receipts derived from an invoice can be created.
prjChitS1=The data entry screen (fields are auto-filled if the receipt is derived from an invoice).
prjChitS2=A demo receipt generated by the program.

prjForm=Generic Document Generator
prjFormDescr=A application for land surveyors built on top of OpenOffice, which takes input values from the user and optionally \
an XML file (generated by some external program) and generates documents using user specified templates. The values \
given by the user or read from the XML are either filled directly in the templates or are used to build tables \
and hide / show sections.
prjFormS1=The static input fields of the generator.
prjFormS2=The file selection, template selection and the input field for the optional XML file.
prjFormS3=The output of the generator.

prjSrv=Server Manager
prjSrvDescr=A program specifically designed to manage dedicated servers for a video game that I played some time ago (Mount and Blade \
Warband). It allowed the simultaneous management of several servers, checking the logs, creating reports, scheduling start, stop or \
restart actions.
prjSrvS1=The first screen of the program. Allows the user to add or remove servers, to view the current status or to edit configurations.
prjSrvS2=The redirected console of the selected server (both input and output).
prjSrvS3=The event scheduler for the selected server.
prjSrvS4=The event log for a server.

prjSwa=Swadian Roleplay Mod
prjSwaDescr=This was a very complex project in which I was involved in my early development career. It was a mod (custom module) for \
Mount and Blade Warband which aimed to completely change the game concept without forcing players to download anything. For this \
project, I was the sole developer (even though multiple other people supported the mod in various other ways). It consisted of \
modified Python scripts which were run by the server, PHP administration consoles, C / C++ log parsers. At some point, I have \
also injected assembly code inside the binaries of the game itself to add some missing features which could not be achieved with \
the python scripts.

prjWorkInternship=.msg Internship Applications
prjWorkInternshipDescr=Several primary insurance small UI5 applications. All of them had SAP Netweaver Gateway backend \
services, which exposed RFCs from .msg standard modules (msg.PIA, msg.ISL). Most of the applications targeted the transport \
insurance segment (msg.ISL) and two of them targeted small goods primary insurance (glasses and mobile phones - msg.PIA).
prjWorkInternship1=Using the bill creation application, the user can add several items to a new bill.
prjWorkInternship2=Then the user must either search for the customer (business partner) or create a new one.
prjWorkInternship3=At the end, the user must agree to the terms and conditions. A PDF receipt is created afterwards.

prjWorkNguw=Next Generation Underwriting
prjWorkNguwDesc=Project launched as a start-up for a small company part of the msg group. It focuses on aiding \
underwriters in their work through predictive analytics and pre-built business rules. My role in this project \
was similar to a full stack developer (working on all components of the application), whilst also being responsible for most \
of the design / architecture decisions.

prjWorkDiias=Insurance as a service
prjWorkDiiasDesc=A continuation of the "Next Generation Underwriting" project, but focused more towards cloud \
enablement. The project consists of several smaller prototypes or showcases that aim to be deployed on a cloud \
platform (e.g. AWS). I had mostly development-related tasks related to building our MEAN-stack-based solution.

prjWorkLrm=msg.LRM
prjWorkLrmDesc=Various projects centered on msg.LRM (Life Reinsurance Module). Initially, to get acquainted to \
the module and the underlying framework, I was part of the standard development team. Afterwards, I worked on various \
customization projects for different customers (Transamerica, Nan Shan Life).

prjWorkFsPm=SAP FS-PM
prjWorkFsPmDesc=A small customer addition to SAP FS-PM (Financial Services - Policy Management) for MSIG Insurance.

prjWorkHCP=HANA Cloud Platform Evaluation

prjWorkTaxoengine2=The same results, but compared against the typical profile of a Java Developer (as deduced by the engine).

prjWorkGenRe=GenRe GTFE Analysis Reports
prjWorkGenReDesc=A customer add-on to FS-RI (Financial Services - Reinsurance) for the General Reinsurance Company. The add-on consisted \
of three UI5 applications which pulled various performance indicators calculated by ABAP CDS views and exposed through \
Netweaver Gateway services.

prjEpmWebsockets=EPM WebSocket
prjEpmWebsocketsDesc=A small personal project which realized the following technical achievement: real-time communication \
between an ABAP based user interface (classic Dynpro), a UI5 interface hosted on the ABAP system and a UI5 interface \
hosted on the cloud platform. The data model used for this proof of concept was the SAP Enterprise Procurement Model (EPM).

prjUi5Auth=UI5 Authorization
prjUi5AuthDesc=Lightweight open-source UI5 library which enables developers to build user interfaces which adapt at runtime to user roles. \
The main goal of this library is to decouple the responsibilities of regular UI5 applications: role-based adaptation should be \
done declaratively and centrally for each app.

prjUi5Viz=UI5 Graph Visualization
prjUi5VizDesc=A simple open-source UI5 library for displaying graph data. I built it using a D3 force-graph graph layout.

prjSbwo=Small Business Work Organizer
prjSbwoDesc=A Java standalone application, with an embedded web server (servlet container) and embedded database. The application \
aims to help small business to store, manage and use their business data. I have built this project as an exercise in implementing \
various mechanisms from scratch (like user authentication, session management, scheduling, etc.) to enhance my skills and understanding \
of the respective concepts.

prjSdBank=Bank
prjSdBankDesc=A small bank application on the cloud. Has two types of users (admin and customer) with different roles. \
Persistency was done with plain JDBC and the user interface with UI5. This application was later remade (as part of a \
different course) by using Hibernate, SpringMVC and AngularJS.

prjTicket=Ticket System (Mockup)
prjTicketDesc=A UI-only application for an online, web-based ticketing system. It has three types of users: customers \
which may open support tickets, employees which must solve the tickets and managers which can oversee the performance \
of the employees and must solve any customer complaints.
prjTicket1=The view which displays a customer's previously opened tickets.
prjTicket2=The view which shows an employee's unsolved tickets.
prjTicket3=The employee performance statistics application for managers.

prjSdBookstore=Bookstore
prjSdBookstoreDesc=A small bookstore on the cloud. Is very similar to the bank applications, but the persistency was \
done in XML files (stored in a Document Store) and the user also has the possibility of generating reports in various \
formats (TXT, XML, CSV).
prjSdBookstore1=The home page of an admin user (notice the tiles for generating reports).

prjSdHospital=Hospital
prjSdHospitalDesc=Hospital appointment management cloud application realized with JPA and UI5. \
Real-time notifications were supported by using WebSocket communication between the clients and the cloud.

prjSdHospital2=The patients list as seen by a nurse or secretary. The opened dialog can be used to make a new appointment.
prjSdHospital3=A real-time notification received by the doctor when one of his patients has arrived at the hospital.

prjSdDocumentGenerator=Document Generator (Remake)
prjSdDocumentGeneratorDesc=A remake of the original Generic Document Generator (personal project), with MongoDB \
for storing the document templates, ApacheDerby + JDBC for storing the various user, template and field configurations \
and an UI5 interface. The OpenOffice API was called directly from Java to generate the documents.
prjSdDocumentGenerator0=The field configuration view (allows the users to define custom field validations).
prjSdDocumentGenerator1=The document generation view. The users must fill in all defined fields with valid values.

prjAlp=Assembly Graph Plotter
prjAlpDesc=A mathematical functions graph plotting application entirely written in assembly. The user is able to enter \
the mathematical formula in the console and then the program plots the function's graph.
prjAlp1=The formula entry console prompt sequence.
prjAlp2=The resulting graph plot.

prjBachelor=Bachelor Degree Project
prjBachelorDesc=A Shipment Management, Tracking and Analysis application targeted at the transport insurance industry \
branch. It consists of two tracking device prototypes (Android and Arduino) which communicate with SAP HANA based \
cloud services. These services store the data, send out notifications (by using a Java microservice) if certain conditions are met and process \
the collected figures to produce various statistics and analytical scenarios.
prjBachelor1=The sensor maintenance application.
prjBachelor2=The real-time tracking application with a transport being currently selected.
prjBachelor3=The transport evolution comparison application (the user has selected to align the starts of the data series).
prjBachelor4=The overall statistics application output.

prjUi5Jsx=UI5 JSX Renderer
prjUi5JsxDesc=Babel plugin for transpiling inline JSX into UI5 Render Manager calls. It enables very easy custom \
control creation.
